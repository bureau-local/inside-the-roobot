## CODE
STEP ONE - COLLECT EVERY INVOICE SUBMITTED TO IWGB
This is done with get-data-from-api.py

We collect everything except for invoices that weren't successfully parsed and test data. We include the date in the output file's name in case we need to refer to an earlier version of the data at some point in the future.
